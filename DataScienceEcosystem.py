# ### Arithmetic Expression Examples
# 
# Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.
# 

# In[3]:


# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
result = (3 * 4) + 5
result


# In[4]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
hours
